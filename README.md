Ciphering and Deciphering Project
Overview
This project provides ciphering and deciphering capabilities using the following algorithms:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Hill Cipher
Playfair Cipher
Additionally, the project includes a web page interface for easy use of these algorithms.

Features
AES Encryption/Decryption: Symmetric encryption technique using the AES algorithm.
Extended Euclidean Algorithm: Used for finding the greatest common divisor and for solving linear Diophantine equations.
Hill Cipher: A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
Playfair Cipher: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.

Usage
Running the Web Application
Navigate to the project directory.

Start the Flask web server:

sh
Copy code
python app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Using the Web Interface
AES: Input your plaintext and key, then select either encryption or decryption.
Extended Euclidean Algorithm: Input your two integers to find their greatest common divisor and coefficients.
Hill Cipher: Input your plaintext, key matrix, and choose either encryption or decryption.
Playfair Cipher: Input your plaintext and key, then select either encryption or decryption.
